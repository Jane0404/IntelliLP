It is a personal project for technology-ehnhanced learning. I started thinking about its prototype from September 2019. It was initially prepared for applying the PhD program at MCLS as my research proposal. Enlighted by AlphaZero, I planed to use deep learning technologyies to created a novel learning platfrom.

AIFEIGO is a game learning platform. It is augmented with deep learning technologies and learning theories like collaborative learning and gamification. Its goal is to enhance learners' decision-making skills in board games by real-time evaluations and predictions generated from deep neural networks. 

I am developing it by using React, MobX, Node.js, Express, RESTful, MongoDB, and PyTorch. 

npm run server  //start the server at localhost:3000

npm run client // webpack bundles webpages
